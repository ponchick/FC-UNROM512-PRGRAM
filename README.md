## Jumpers (board configuration)

### 1) Flash memory mode (write protection / self-flashing)

| Configuration | `FL1`-`FL4` | `FLASHABLE` | 74*139 | Bus conflicts |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Not Flashable** (write-protected) | Closed | Open | Not installed | **Present** |
| **Flashable** (self-flashable) | Open | Closed | Installed | **Absent** |

### 2) Mirroring

**Mirroring must match the ROM you are programming.** The game expects a specific mode (vertical/horizontal/1-screen). A wrong setting causes visual glitches.

Only one of these jumpers should be closed. For **Vertical mirroring**, close `VERT` and keep `HORIZ` and `ONE` open.

### 3) CHR RAM size configuration (8/16/32 KiB)

**The actual CHR RAM size is defined by the physical RAM chip** (for example, 62256 = 32 KiB). Jumpers only route the required address lines.

| Size | `8k` | `8k/16k` | `16k/32k` | `32k` |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 8 KiB | Closed | Closed | Open | Open |
| 16 KiB | Open | Closed | Closed | Open |
| 32 KiB | Open | Open | Closed | Closed |

> **Use smaller CHR RAM sizes (8/16 KiB) only if the target ROM explicitly supports them.** Most UNROM512 / Mapper 30 software expects 32 KiB. Forcing a smaller size on unsupported ROMs can cause errors.
